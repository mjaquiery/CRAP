We have three main roles: [developing theory](#Developing theory), [designing experiments](#Designing experiments), [sharing data](#Sharing data), and [discussing interpretations](#Discussing interpretations).

## Developing theory

Members of the _Consortium_ discuss competing theories which can explain scientific findings in profanity research. 
These discussions can involve developing new theories, identifying existing results which are in need of replication, determining critical tests of competing theories, and arranging adversarial collaborations.

The breadth and depth of knowledge represented by members of the _Consortium_, which span from neuroscience to linguistics, means that members can form small groups who can develop more complete theories than they might be able to alone. 

The [replication crisis]() in science has highlighted the importance of having reliable data which we can use for constructing theories. 
A key part of the theory development process is identifying existing results which may be unreliable and which would stop us from developing true theories if they were taken at face value. 
We can then [develop robust and replicable protocols](#Designing experiments) for repeating these experiments.

[Critical tests]() are an important way to tell which of some competing theories is true. Where theories make clear and different predictions about what will happen if we manipulate something in an experiment, we can conduct that experiment and look at the results to see which of the theories' predictions was closest to what actually happened. 
An important part of developing theories together is being able to identify where different theories make different predictions about things we can test.

Researchers often feel quite strongly about their own work, and this can mean that sometimes there are 'turf wars' over whether a particular experiment _really_ counts as a test of a theory. 
[Adversarial collaborations]() can help with this by allowing researchers with different commitments to agree on whether an experiment will be a good test of their theories before they run the experiments and get to see the results.

## Designing experiments

_Consortium_ members work together to design experiments. 
Designing experiments means taking the idea of a manipulation which can separate the predictions of different theories and turning it into a project suitable for undergraduate research by devising the experimental materials and protocols.
The experiments designed by the _Consortium_ will be simple enough to be conducted by undergraduates in their final year of study in the appropriate field, and each of these studies will be a self-contained project with room for extension, analysis, and interpretation by the researcher.
These studies will have a core kernal of overlapping data which can be combined by members of the _Consortium_ to explore the predictions made by the competing theories. 
In this way the experiments serve both the purpose of teaching developing researchers and answering questions which are too difficult to answer with individual undergraduate research projects.

In order to facilitate experimentation, the _Consortium_ will produce protocols and materials which are available to all members. 
This may include things like simulating data to predict results in line with differing theories, writing code for experimental paradigms, and providing questionnaires and forms for participants to complete; making sure translations resources are available  so the same experiment can be performed in different countries.
Another important part of our work is making it as simple as possible for Research Ethics Committees to understand and approve the methods used in the experiments.

## Sharing data

When data has been collected it is shared with members of the _Consortium_ and, where possible, other researchers in the wider scientific community.
This sharing means that the small quantities of data collected by individual researchers during individual experiments can be brought together to answer important questions in reliable ways. 
It also means that different teams can explore different ways to examine the data, and that the data can be used to investigate different questions from the ones it was collected to answer.

## Discussing interpretations

The last part of the _Consortium's_ role is discussing and disseminating the interpretations of the data collected in experiments.
This involves explaining the results of the research to other researchers, the media, and members of the public.
Finally, we all go back to the beginning and discuss new theories, or modifications to old theories, which can account for the results we've found in our research, and the whole process starts again.
