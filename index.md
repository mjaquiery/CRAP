# Welcome to the _Consortium for Research About Profanity_

The _Consortium for Research About Profanity_ is a collection of researchers working on understanding the ways in which profanity functions in minds and societies. 

## Why make a _Consortium_? 

Research into profanity is interesting and fun, but so far it has been conducted using disconnected small-scale projects. 
This has meant that it has been difficult to come up with solid and useful theories about the ways profanity impacts our experiences in the real world. 
The _Consortium_ will help to solve this problem by connecting networks of international researchers across a variety of disciplines who can benefit from one another's expertise and share data with one another.
