Profanity has been investigated in numerous ways across numerous disciplines. As a part of the overarching project, we want to draw up a rough taxonomy of approaches.

Several members of the Consortium, from a variety of different disciplines, will provide short accounts of how their discipline defines and investigates profanity, the major questions surrounding its use, and any key theories or discoveries made thus far. These accounts will then be edited together.
