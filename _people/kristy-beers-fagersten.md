Kristy Beers Fägersten is Professor of English Linguistics at Södertörn University, Sweden. Kristy has been researching swearing since graduate school, having written her dissertation on swearing in English from a sociolinguistic perspective. She has since included discourse analysis and conversation analysis methodology and theory in her research, focusing on the pragmatic functions of swearing and the role of swearing in talk-in-interaction. Recurring themes in Kristy’s research are the relationship between swearing and humor and the use of English swear words in Sweden. 

Kristy is the author of _Who’s swearing now? The social aspects and pragmatic functions of conversational swearing_ (2012) and co-editor (with [Karyn Stapleton](/who-we-are/#karyn-stapleton)) of _Advances in swearing research. New languages and new contexts_ (2017). Additional publications include “English-language swearwords as humor in Swedish comic strips” (2017), “The role of swearing in creating an online persona: The case of YouTuber PewDiePie” (2017), “FUCK CANCER, _Fucking Åmål, Aldrig fucka upp_: The standardization of fuck in Swedish media” (2017), and “Swearwords for sale: The commodification of swearing” (2021). Kristy is a member of the swearing research network, “Swearing in Scandinavia” (SwiSca) and was the organizer of “Perfunctory, pragmatic, and pain-relieving: The 6th Swearing in Scandinavia Symposium” (2019). 

Kristy doesn't swear much at all, but she talks about swearing all the more. Here are some examples - in Swedish, but the swear words are in English:
